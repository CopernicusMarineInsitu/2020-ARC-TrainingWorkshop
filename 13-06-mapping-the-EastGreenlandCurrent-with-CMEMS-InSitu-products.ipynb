    "CMEMS catalog enable users to access a wide range of data products based on model forecasts and observations (remote and insitu). In this notebook we aim to showcase its usability for monitoring the East Greenland Current, one of the major reponsible for Ice transportation (cold and freswater inputs) off the Arctic region and into the adjacent seas (i.e Labrador Sea and North Atlantic Ocean). This current is can be envisaged as the counterpart of the North Atlantic Current (warm and salty), that in this case discurs in the oposite direction (south-nort) along the Norwegian Sea. The implications of the any strengthening of this current are numerous (i.e find some described [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53723-z)) and therefore its monitoring is key for undertanding upcomming changes in the area.
